Integrating a Physics Engine with Deep Neural Networks

This project was made during Jean Ponce's course "Object recognition and computer vision" (M2 MVA 2016 - 2017). We aimed at
integrating a Physics Engine with Deep Neural Networks with weak supervision. 

More precisely, we implemented a way to automatically annotate physics videos via baysian inference of the parameters of a known physical system, e.g a simple pendulum.

Used several tutorials:
